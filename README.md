I built this website to show you who I am and what I can do in 2026.
It’s not just a list of my work; it’s a place where you can play with cool AI tools I made.
You can create new pictures from your ideas or talk to my smart AI assistant right here.
I used bright colors and smooth movements to make the experience feel fun and modern.
My goal was to make everything easy to read, even if you don’t know much about technology.
You’ll find my personal story, my college background, and the projects I’m most proud of.
I also included a gallery of photos to show different sides of my creative life.
If you want to chat or work together, you can send me a message through the AI chat box.
I really wanted this portfolio to feel alive and helpful for everyone who visits.
I hope you enjoy looking around my digital home!
